## Project Timeline & Tasks

### Phase 1: Setup and Initial Implementation
- [ ] Create project structure with directories and files.
- [ ] Implement basic BLE scanning in ble_presence_agent.
- [ ] Map BLE devices to occupant IDs.
- [ ] Integrate Home Assistant API in common/ha_api.py.
- [ ] Implement behavior analysis model in behavior_agent.
- [ ] Create automation suggestion logic.

### Phase 2: Testing and Integration
- [ ] Test BLE scanning on hardware.
- [ ] Validate data flow from ble_presence_agent to behavior_agent.
- [ ] Integrate with Home Assistant for automation creation.

### Phase 3: Refinement and Deployment
- [ ] Refine AI models and improve pattern recognition.
- [ ] Optimize Docker containers for production.
- [ ] Setup logging and error handling.
- [ ] Documentation and user guide.

### Decisions to be Made
- Naming conventions for dynamic agents.
- Choice of AI model: rule-based vs machine learning.
- Data storage method: local DB vs Home Assistant database.
- Automation approval process: manual vs automatic.

# TODO
